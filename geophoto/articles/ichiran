One of the best ways to find good food in Tokyo is look for a long line, and this is definitely true for Ichiran Ramen.  I’ve only ever been here late at night or early in the morning, a good window is 1AM - 10AM for a manageable wait.  But even if you’re only able to make it down during the busiest part of the day, this is ramen worth waiting for.

The Shinjuku location is about a 2 minute walk from the South Exit of JR Shinjuku.  It’s pretty easy to find, it’s on a street full of restaurants and coffee shops, and right next to a Lawson Station.  The logo is also pretty distinctive, but there isn’t a super-obvious “ICHIRAN RAMEN” in latin script like for Starbucks or Burger King.  Mostly just look for the line.  There’ll be someone in a red shirt, with a red apron, tending to the line once it has extended up the stairs.

Ichiran is unique because you get to specify exactly how you want it - from the richness of the broth to the texture of the noodles.  It’s available spicy, which is key for some of us… but be careful because the spice makes the delicious broth a bit of a killer when you go to finish it off.

The other key aspect of Ichiran is “kae dama”.  Basically, if you’re the hungry type, you can eat all your noodles and meat (and any other fixins like the soft-boiled egg), and get those refilled.  Just remember, there’s no refills on soup, so take it easy on the broth until you’ve decided you’re closing in on full.  Also available is draft Asahi at a reasonable price.

The gig is this - wait in line for a while, buy your meal tickets at the vending machine (it’s got pictures and English), get a spec sheet from the attendant (this is available in English, Chinese and Korean, in addition to Japanese of course), fill that out and be seated.  If it’s not busy, you’ll hit the vending machine and grab a stool, you’ll be provided with your order sheet at your seat in that case, but you may need to ask specifically for an English one.

The ramen is fantastic, I get mine extra rich, regular spicy, 2 garlic, with soft noodles.  The soft-boiled egg is a fantastic addition, and I don’t know who would order without the pork.

Ichiran is not the best ramen in all of Japan; however, it is consistently awesome and a unique experience, from the individual booths to the way you specify your order and the kae dama.
